# Questions
#
# 2.1.1 What are the training and test accuracy values you get? Why might we be interested in both training accuracy and testing accuracy? What do these two numbers tell us about our current model?
# TODO
#
# 2.1.2 Try varying the model parameter for learning rate to different powers of 10 (i.e. 10^1, 10^0, 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3) and training the model. What patterns do you see and how does the choice of learning rate affect both the loss during training and the final model accuracy?
# TODO
#
# 2.1.3 Try varying the parameter for weight decay to different powers of 10: (10^0, 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5). How does weight decay affect the final model training and test accuracy?
# TODO
#
# 2.2.1 Currently the model uses a logistic activation for the first layer. Try using a the different activation functions we programmed. How well do they perform? What's best?
# TODO
#
# 2.2.2 Using the same activation, find the best (power of 10) learning rate for your model. What is the training accuracy and testing accuracy?
# TODO
#
# 2.2.3 Right now the regularization parameter `decay` is set to 0. Try adding some decay to your model. What happens, does it help? Why or why not may this be?
# TODO
#
# 2.2.4 Modify your model so it has 3 layers instead of two. The layers should be `inputs -> 64`, `64 -> 32`, and `32 -> outputs`. Also modify your model to train for 3000 iterations instead of 1000. Look at the training and testing error for different values of decay (powers of 10, 10^-4 -> 10^0). Which is best? Why?
# TODO
#
# 3.1.1 What is the best training accuracy and testing accuracy? Summarize all the hyperparameter combinations you tried.
# TODO
